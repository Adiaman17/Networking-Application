# Networking_In_Java
Networking means communication between two or more devices connected in a network. Networking allows sharing of files, data among a group
of users. Java allows user to develop a complete system to communicate between certain users.


## Java Networking
 For networking in Java firstly we should know that how many sockets java allows us to use ? Java allows us to use two sockets:
 - Stream Sockets
 > Stream Sockets use TCP protocol to create a communication between two systems. Here data flows in the form of Continous Streams while the connection is in place.
 
 - Datagram Sockets
 > Datagram Sockets use UDP protocol in which the packets of information are shared between two systems. It is Connection-less service protocol.

 
 ## Communication Using UDP
 
 ### Half Duplex
 - First Run the **Server.java** program so that server gets ready to recieve the messages then run the **Client.java** program.
     
 ### Full Duplex
- First Run the **Server.java** program so that server gets ready to recieve the messages then run the **Client.java** program.


 ## Communication Using TCP
 
 ### Half Duplex
 - First Run the **Server.java** program so that server gets ready to recieve the messages then run the **Client.java** program.
 
     
 ### Full Duplex
 - First Run the **Server.java** program so that server gets ready to recieve the messages then run the **Client.java** program.
